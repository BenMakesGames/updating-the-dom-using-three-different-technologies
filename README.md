# Updating the DOM Using Three Different Technologies

I made this in response to a question I received from a player of Poppy Seed Pets; a new programmer who wanted to know "how can I update the HTML using JavaScript?"

I thought it'd be interesting to show how to do this in three ways:
1. using plain ol' JavaScript
2. using jQuery
3. using Angular

if you've never done this kind of thing before, Angular is probably not the way to go for your first time :P just getting the Angular project to run locally will probably be a bit of a challenge.

the other two, however, you can literally just double-click on the `.html` files to open them in your browser (or drag-and-drop them into an open browser window/tab), and they'll just work!
